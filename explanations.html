    <h5>Paul Adamson:</h5>
    <h5>I came up with a temperature scale that is measured in ohms. Thus, the temperature of free space, in my</h5>
    <h5>model, is equal to the impedance of free space. Z0 = Ta0, and Z = Ta. There are good reasons for that</h5>
    <h5>decision.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Also, in my model, the curvature of space is created by the impedance mismatch that occurs along the paths</h5>
    <h5>of quantum transport, between quanta that experience intermodulation interference, during transit.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Thus, it should follow that the temperature and impedance of space, will vary with the apparent contour</h5>
    <h5>of space.  One of the descriptions of gravity, that my model asserts, is that gravity is a quantum traffic</h5>
    <h5>jam. I detail that in other posts. But, it is easily observed and explained that gravity wells occur where</h5>
    <h5>quantum traffic is heaviest.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>My model also asserts that mass is the result of that same intermodulation interference experienced by</h5>
    <h5>the quanta working their way through that traffic jam. Remember that not only photons, but also massive</h5>
    <h5>particles, are made of quanta in transit.  The temperature and impedance of space varies with the density</h5>
    <h5>of the quantum traffic through that space.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>The model gets more interesting still, as it asserts that dark quanta express their influence on local</h5>
    <h5>traffic, through Z0, which is seemingly constant by the law of large numbers. Regular quanta's influence is</h5>
    <h5>expressed through rX, the reactive component of the impedance formula.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Ta^2 = Z^2 = rX^2 + Z0^2</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Dark quanta are quanta that are detuned from the Planck "channel" of our universe. I occasionally say they</h5>
    <h5>are travelling in parallel universes. That is just a short hand way of saying the same thing. Dark matter</h5>
    <h5>is made of quanta that don't agree with our universal constants.</h5>

    <h5>My model also asserts that every Planck "channel" has a complementary channel with which it shares a Pytha-</h5>
    <h5>gorean relationship.  I refer to one as space-time, and the other as time-space.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>When they are at thermal equilibrium, they agree on the universal constants, when measured using the Ideal</h5>
    <h5>metric system of units, as defined in my calculators.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>This calculator contains a lot more experimental values, related to the two channels.</h5>

    <h5>Ulla Mattfolk:</h5>
    <h5>How is the relation gravity-impedance in the curvature?</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Paul Adamson:</h5>
    <h5>It's lensing, essentially - from the perspective of parallel, quantum transport. Intermodulation interference</h5>
    <h5>between quanta in transit, such that "alien crosstalk" generates the gravitational lensing, which is actually</h5>
    <h5>just standard optical lensing.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Imagine, for instance, that a proton, in the field, is composed of three quarks, which are themselves, made</h5>
    <h5>of quanta in transit. Their mass is primarily generated by the interference between them, but those paths</h5>
    <h5>also form a triple helix through spacetime. Photons may pass close by, and contribute to their path selection,</h5>
    <h5>for instance.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>So, all of these traffic patterns do interact. The aggregation of signal reflections, along paths of quantum</h5>
    <h5>transport do determine the apparent contour of spacetime followed by selected paths.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>We need to look at real quantum transport situations, instead of modeling lone paths, selected by probability</h5>
    <h5>function collapse. Function collapse is a statistical way of approaching the real aggregation of the reflect-</h5>
    <h5>ions of the signals travelling within path bundles, through the emergent quantum field patterns.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>You can actually experiment with real quantum transport over a large bundle of transmission lines. Engineers</h5>
    <h5>do this sort of experimentation when designing cables.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>This is a video that I share, sometimes, to illustrate the idea that mass is born of "alien crosstalk."</h5>

    <h5>There is also a simple experiment that I envision, where the impedance of a gap is continuously measured,</h5>
    <h5>while a laser is modulating the temperature of the space.  This borrows from the idea of an amplifier tube.</h5>
    <br>

    <h5>Paul Adamson:</h5>
    <h5>Exactly. We need to experiment with quantum transport bundles. Also, with cross traffic and proximal</h5>
    <h5>bonding.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Ulla Mattfolk:</h5>
    <h5>What does G stand for on the Planck scale? Does G go so far even?</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Paul Adamson:</h5>
    <h5>At the Planck scale, space is seemingly flat. That's because curvature is scale relative. Put more</h5>
    <h5>simply, the curvature, of that scale perspective, is very gradual. As the scale of observation increases,</h5>
    <h5>the slope grade increases. But, also, larger systems show increasingly larger energy losses, with scale.</h5>
    <h5>The complexity of systems is generally scale relative.</h5>
    <h5>But, as I understand G, it is a conversion factor. I'll give it more thought.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>Here is another video that I like to share, to illustrate where my view is coming from.</h5>
    <p>
      <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DovunOxlY1k&t=74s">
        This is one of my favorite videos.

    <h5>To better understand quantum transport, we should be considering it a matter of signal transmission,</h5>
    <h5>rather than focusing exclusively on the particles generated by those signals.</h5>
    <br>
    <h5>For example, insights into the nature of mass can be gained by applying our understanding of impulse</h5>
    <h5>response filters.  I've modeled that, myself, and will do so again, to share my approach, in the near</h5>
    <h5>future.  Signal reflections are a key concept.</h5>

    <br><br>
    <h5>Reality is a multidimensional interference pattern, existing in the imagination of the Mind of God.</h5>
    <h5>I thank Jesus Christ, my Creator, Lord, and Savior, for revealing this math to me.  I pray His Spirit</h5>
    <h5>will help me to convey it.</h5>
